# IP Info Pro

## What is this project about?

IP Info Pro is a web application that shows you detailed information about your IP address and DNS settings. It's like a mirror for your internet connection, reflecting back important details about how you're connected to the web.

### Main Features:

1. **IP Information**: See where your internet connection is coming from, including:
   - Your IP address
   - Your country and city
   - Your internet service provider (ISP)

2. **DNS Information**: Learn about the Domain Name System servers you're using, including:
   - The IP address of your DNS server
   - Where your DNS server is located

## Where does the information come from?

We use the IP Geolocation API to get information about IP addresses. Here's why it's great:

- It's fast and accurate
- It's free for non-commercial use
- You don't need an API key to use it
- It's easy to add to any project
- It can give information in different formats (JSON, XML, CSV, Newline, PHP)
- It's trusted by many businesses and handles over 1 billion requests every day

## How to use IP Info Pro

1. Open the website
2. Click "Get Started"
3. View your IP and DNS information

It's that simple!

## Why use IP Info Pro?

- Learn more about your internet connection
